1. 

Consider Ordinance Establishing Urban and Rural Taxing Districts 

  

 

 

 

 

Minutes: 

City Attorney John Shockley explained that this ordinance was a result of a recent 
detachment petition.  The Administrative Law Judge advised the City to consider 
such an ordinance as provided by Minnesota State Statutes.  As vacant farmland, 
such properties do not receive customary City services.  Under the Rural Taxing 
District, if the property is developed in the future, it will change back to the urban 
designation.  Parcels that qualify for the Rural Taxing District are defined by law, and 
if the parcel meets the criteria, it is included. 
 

•  City Planner Kristie Leshovsky stated that if the Ordinance is implemented, 

it would only apply to municipal taxes, not school district or county taxes.  
The Ordinance would affect 1,068 acres, or 13% of the land within the City 
limits.  Detachment proceedings are governed by Minnesota Statute 414.06  
which lists five criteria for the property:  1) it is rural in character and is not 
developed;  2) it is located within the City limits; 3) the change would not 
unreasonably affect the symmetry of abutting property; 4) the property is not 
needed for future development; and, 5) the City can continue to function 
without the parcel. 

 
At questions from the City Council, staff clarified the following: 

• 

If this Ordinance is not passed, there may be other landowners who chose 
to petition for detachment. 

•  Oakport Township properties have not been analyzed for possible rural 

designation, but will be before orderly annexation occurs in 2015. 

•  The City will continue to receive the same amount of revenue, but tax 

burden will shift from rural to urban property at present levy rate.  

•  The change does not affect any special assessments on the property. 
•  Minimum City services are continued to the property. 
•  There are no limits on the size of the parcel affected, but such limits could 

be added at Council’s discretion. 

•  Minnesota State Statute requires a 30-day period before first reading of the 

ordinance.
